This article aims to define the concept of 'an average', how it evolved over time. The pioneer of the concept, a Belgium Mathematician named Adolfe Quetelet, gave more on the idea and how his findings helped in shaping the modern world that we live in today.
We can relate the concept of average in every thing around us such as the number of times any event is repeated (qunatitative) and also the amount of time it takes to complete a task (qualitative). So, how the concept of 'an average' relates to Accessibility and Usability? Let's dive deeper in the subject.
Before, diving into the matter, we need to know what is Accessibilty and Usability. According to the Government of Canada Standard on the Web Accesibility, it is making the content of the web more accesible to wider range of disabilites including blindess and low vision, deafness, movement limitations, cognitive limitations etc. Usability, on the other hand, according to the Government of Canada Standard on the Usability, is to what extent the specified users can find the information effectively and effieciently online.
The concept of 'an average' is important in this context because with the study of average difficulties that a user may have while interacting with the web can determine more probable solutions that can include wider range of users for the system.
